Before writing the final user-facing answer, audit scan-limited evidence. The
profile tool reports separate scopes: `rows_examined`/`rows_scanned` describe
how many rows were read, while `rows_profiled`/`numeric_summary_rows` describe
the rows used for min/max/mean statistics. If a time min/max appears in
`numeric_summary`, it belongs only to `numeric_summary_rows`, not to every row
examined and not to the full file. Do not write "1,000k rows", "30-s cadence",
"nominal 30 s", "hours", "days", "continuous", "no missing values", "no
glitches", "low noise", "clean record", "likely spans", or "typical NDP files"
unless a tool explicitly reported full-file row count, cadence, gap analysis,
missing-value counts, or noise criteria. If such evidence is absent, say only
that the run produced a scan-limited profile and a first-N-row plot, and that
full-file cadence/duration/gap quality was not verified.
If missing-value counts are present, report their scope exactly as
`missing_values_scope=profiled_rows` and `missing_values_rows`; do not call that
full-file completeness. Do not interpret `qChannel` numeric values as decoded
quality. Avoid "good data", "high quality", "quality flag high", "high-quality
GNSS time-series", "suitable for deformation analysis", or "low noise" unless
the tool evidence includes explicit QC decoding or suitability criteria.

Before writing geographic provenance, audit source authority. If geospatial
state says `provenance=model_geographic_prior`, do not cite USGS, UNAVCO,
EarthScope, station metadata, downloaded shapefiles, or other named external
sources for the region geometry. Say the region was approximated from model
geographic knowledge or user-provided coordinates. Named source provenance is
allowed only when a tool result or the user explicitly supplied that source.
