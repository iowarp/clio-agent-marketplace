# Ingesting HDF5 into clio-core (CTE/CAE)

## Purpose

Decide **whether** to route an HDF5 file through clio-core's blob store
(ingest via the CAE assimilator = `context_bundle`, read back via the CTE data
plane) instead of reading it natively with h5py — and **how** to do it without
falling into the slow paths. Guidance is grounded in benchmarking on the
dev-container build (functional/relative comparison, not absolute GB/s).

## TL;DR decision rule

- **Default: read natively with h5py.** Bundling into clio-core is *not* a
  read-latency optimization — across every fixture tested, clio-core read
  latency is higher than native h5py (2–8× warm; never lower than even a *cold*
  native read). Reach for clio-core for its *other* properties (cross-node shared
  residency, multi-tier placement), not to make a single client's reads faster.
- **Concurrent readers on ONE node do not change this.** Benchmarked N=1..8
  readers of the same dataset: clio-core lost to native h5py at every N and was
  slower than even a cold native read, with aggregate throughput plateauing
  (~1400 MB/s, single-daemon serialization) and ~2× the memory. On a single node
  the OS page cache already gives concurrent readers a shared cached copy for
  free. clio-core's sharing benefit is for **cross-node** sharing and
  **larger-than-RAM** working sets — neither of which native h5py + a local page
  cache can serve, and neither tested here. Do not pitch single-node concurrency
  as a clio-core win.
- **If you do ingest: consolidate first.** The cost is per-*object*, not
  per-byte. Many small datasets are catastrophic; few large datasets are fine.

## Practice 1 — Consolidate small datasets before ingest (biggest lever)

Ingest + retrieve cost scales **linearly with dataset (object) count**, at a
near-constant **~11–20 ms per dataset** for a full read — versus ~0.1 ms/dataset
for native h5py. That is a **~100–200× per-object penalty**, measured across
10 → 8,533 datasets:

| datasets | native read | clio-core read | penalty |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 10 | 1.3 ms | 115 ms | ~90× |
| 100 | 11 ms | 1.1 s | ~100× |
| 1,000 | 112 ms | 12.4 s | ~110× |
| 8,533 | 0.9 s | 173 s | ~196× |

**Action:** before bundling a file with thousands of small datasets, consolidate
them into fewer, larger datasets (concatenate along a new axis, or pack into one
table). A file that is one big dataset bundles in tens of ms; the same bytes
spread over thousands of datasets take minutes. If you cannot consolidate,
prefer native h5py.

## Practice 2 — Don't bundle to make reads faster (it doesn't amortize)

The intuition "pay ingest once, then cheap reads forever" does **not** hold here.
Break-even N (reads before ingest pays off) was **"never" at every scale** —
clio-core's warm read is slower than a *cold* native read even for large
contiguous data:

| dataset size | native cold | native warm | clio-core warm | break-even |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 256 MB | 293 ms | 61 ms | 396 ms | never |
| 1 GB | 1.1 s | 225 ms | 1.55 s | never |
| 2 GB | 2.1 s | 398 ms | 3.2 s | never |

The cost is **per-chunk** (CTE re-chunks at 1.5 MB → a 2 GB dataset is ~1,400
blobs, each a round-trip). **Action:** justify bundling by sharing/tiering
needs, not read speed. The only situation where bundling can win is when the
*native* read is itself unusually expensive (e.g. heavily strided/random access)
**and** the file is re-read many times — verify with a quick A/B before
committing to it.

## Practice 3 — Use selective retrieve for subsets

If you need a subset of datasets, retrieve only those — retrieve cost scales with
the number requested (K), not the file total (N). Selecting ~10% of a
many-dataset file cost ~10× less than retrieving all of it. **Action:** filter by
tag/blob pattern at retrieve time rather than pulling the whole bundle. (Ingest
still reads the whole file — ingest-side dataset filtering is not yet exposed.)

## Practice 4 — Per-byte scaling is fine; it's objects/chunks that hurt

clio-core scales gracefully with data *size* (read overhead is a constant ~3×
cold / ~6–8× warm from 256 MB to 2 GB) but badly with object/chunk *count*.
**Action:** large contiguous datasets are the friendly case; high object counts
are the hostile one. Optimize the file's structure (fewer objects), not its
total size.

## API gotchas (when ingest is actually warranted)

- Routing is by the `src` **protocol prefix**, not the `format` field:
  `hdf5::` → semantic per-dataset ingest (one tag per dataset); `file::` →
  opaque whole-file byte chunking. `format=` is cosmetic and ignored for routing.
- Read array data back via the CTE data plane (`Tag.GetBlob`), **not** the CEE
  `context_retrieve` text layer — the latter is UTF-8 and raises
  `UnicodeDecodeError` on binary. Order `chunk_N` blobs by numeric index.
- The assimilator ingests whole datasets only; it does **not** read HDF5
  attributes, and hyperslab/attribute reads are not available through it.

## Common pitfalls

- **`src="file::"` with `format="hdf5"`** → silently gets the opaque binary
  chunker (no per-dataset structure).
- **Bundling a many-small-dataset file as-is** → minutes of per-object overhead.
  Consolidate, or don't bundle.
- **Expecting attributes / hyperslab reads** → not supported by the assimilator.
