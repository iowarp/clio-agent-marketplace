# Cloud-Optimized HDF5

## Purpose

Cloud-optimized HDF5 is a pattern for writing regular HDF5 files that perform efficiently when accessed from cloud object storage (S3, Azure Blob, etc.) via HTTP byte-range requests.

**Related skills**: `hdf5-chunking` for chunk size configuration, `hdf5-filters` for compression strategies.

## What Cloud-Optimized HDF5 Is

**It's a pattern, not a format**: Cloud-optimized HDF5 files are regular `.h5` files written with specific strategies that enable efficient remote access. No special format or conversion required.

**Recent advances** (2025): Properly configured HDF5 files achieve performance on par with cloud-native formats like Zarr without reformatting data or generating metadata sidecar files (Kerchunk, DMR++).

**Core challenge**: Traditional HDF5 was designed for local filesystem I/O with low-latency random access. Cloud object storage has high latency (10-100ms per request) but good bandwidth. Optimization focuses on minimizing request count rather than maximizing transfer speed.

## Key Concepts

**Byte-Range Requests**: Cloud object storage doesn't support POSIX file operations. Instead, clients make HTTP GET requests with byte-range headers to fetch specific portions of files. Each request has latency overhead.

**The Metadata Problem**: Default HDF5 scatters metadata in small blocks (often 4KB) throughout files. On cloud storage, this requires dozens or hundreds of separate HTTP requests just to locate data before accessing it.

**Latency vs Bandwidth Trade-off**:
- Local disk: Low latency (~0.1ms), moderate bandwidth
- Cloud storage: High latency (10-100ms), high bandwidth
- Strategy: Reduce request count (minimize latency hits), accept larger transfers

## Core Optimization Patterns

### 1. Consolidated Metadata (Paged Aggregation)

**Use paged aggregation file space management strategy** to consolidate all file-level metadata at the front of the file.

```python
import h5py

# Create file with paged aggregation
fcpl = h5py.h5p.create(h5py.h5p.FILE_CREATE)
fcpl.set_file_space_strategy(
    strategy=h5py.h5f.FILE_SPACE_STRATEGY_PAGE,
    threshold=0,
    page_size=1024*1024  # 1 MB pages (NOT default 4KB!)
)

fid = h5py.h5f.create(
    b'cloud_optimized.h5',
    flags=h5py.h5f.ACC_TRUNC,
    fcpl=fcpl
)
f = h5py.File(fid)

# Create datasets as normal
dset = f.create_dataset('data', (10000, 10000), chunks=(100, 10000), dtype='f4')
f.close()
```

**Why this matters**: Metadata consolidated in initial pages = few requests to find data = much faster access.

**Page size**: Default 4KB defeats the purpose. Use MB-scale pages (1-10 MB) to truly consolidate metadata.

### 2. Larger Chunk Sizes (10-100 MB)

**Target 10-100 MB chunks** for cloud storage, much larger than typical local disk chunks (1-10 MB).

```python
import h5py
import numpy as np

# Cloud-optimized chunking: larger chunks
with h5py.File('cloud_data.h5', 'w') as f:
    # Example: 1000 x 10000 float32 = 40 MB per chunk
    dset = f.create_dataset(
        'measurements',
        shape=(100000, 10000),
        chunks=(1000, 10000),  # 40 MB chunks
        dtype='f4',
        compression='gzip',
        compression_opts=3
    )
```

**Sizing guidelines**:
- Minimum: 1 MB (sub-MB chunks cause severe performance degradation)
- Target: 10-100 MB depending on dataset size and access patterns
- AWS recommendation: 8-16 MB for optimal byte-range requests
- Pangeo recommendation: ~100 MB for high-performance scientific workloads

**Trade-offs**:
- Larger chunks = fewer requests but more bandwidth per access
- Must balance chunk size with typical read sizes
- Consider memory constraints on client side

### 3. Align Chunk Shape with Access Patterns

Design chunk dimensions to match how data will be read:

```python
# Time-series data: read all variables for time ranges
# Chunk along time dimension
time_series = f.create_dataset(
    'timeseries',
    shape=(100000, 50),  # 100k timesteps, 50 variables
    chunks=(10000, 50),  # Read 10k timesteps at once
    dtype='f4'
)

# Spatial data: read spatial slices at specific times
# Chunk along spatial dimensions
spatial = f.create_dataset(
    'spatial',
    shape=(1000, 1000, 1000),  # time, lat, lon
    chunks=(1, 1000, 1000),    # Single time slice
    dtype='f4'
)
```

**Wrong chunk shape** = every read touches many chunks = wasted bandwidth and excessive requests.

## h5py API for Cloud-Optimized Files

### Basic Pattern

```python
import h5py

# Step 1: Create file creation property list with paged aggregation
fcpl = h5py.h5p.create(h5py.h5p.FILE_CREATE)
fcpl.set_file_space_strategy(
    strategy=h5py.h5f.FILE_SPACE_STRATEGY_PAGE,
    threshold=0,
    page_size=4*1024*1024  # 4 MB pages
)

# Step 2: Create file with fcpl
fid = h5py.h5f.create(b'output.h5', h5py.h5f.ACC_TRUNC, fcpl=fcpl)
f = h5py.File(fid)

# Step 3: Create datasets with appropriate chunking
f.create_dataset(
    'data',
    shape=(50000, 5000),
    chunks=(1000, 5000),  # ~20 MB chunks for float32
    dtype='f4',
    compression='gzip',
    compression_opts=3
)

f.close()
```

### Reading from Cloud Storage

```python
# Using ros3 VFD (read-only S3 access)
import h5py

# Access public S3 bucket
f = h5py.File(
    's3://bucket-name/path/to/file.h5',
    'r',
    driver='ros3',
    aws_region=b'us-west-2'
)

# Access with credentials
f = h5py.File(
    's3://bucket-name/path/to/file.h5',
    'r',
    driver='ros3',
    aws_region=b'us-west-2',
    secret_id=b'ACCESS_KEY_ID',
    secret_key=b'SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'
)

# Read data (each chunk access = one HTTP request)
data = f['dataset'][1000:2000, :]
f.close()
```

## Performance Characteristics

**Well-Optimized Files**:
- Few metadata requests (1-10) due to consolidated metadata
- Predictable data access: one HTTP request per chunk touched
- Performance comparable to Zarr and other cloud-native formats

**Poorly-Optimized Files**:
- Hundreds of small metadata requests before data access begins
- Many requests for small chunks (<1 MB)
- Can be 10-100x slower than optimized files

**Comparison to Local Storage**:
- Local: Random access cheap, many small reads acceptable
- Cloud: Each access costs latency penalty, must batch into larger operations

## Best Practices

- **Always use paged aggregation** for cloud-destined files with MB-scale page size
- **Target 10-100 MB chunks** depending on dataset size and typical access patterns
- **Align chunk shape** with expected read patterns (row-major vs column-major, time slices vs spatial slices)
- **Use moderate compression** (gzip level 3-5) to balance transfer size with decompression overhead
- **Test read patterns** from cloud storage before finalizing chunk strategy
- **Document intended access patterns** so users can optimize their reads
- **Avoid variable-length datatypes** (vlen strings, ragged arrays) - they don't work efficiently with byte-range requests
- **Consider total file size**: Very small files (<100 MB) may not benefit from cloud optimization
- **Profile request count**: Monitor actual HTTP requests during reads to validate optimization

## Major Pitfalls

**Small Chunks (<1 MB)**: Creates excessive HTTP requests. Each request has 10-100ms latency. Chunks <1 MB can reduce throughput to unusable levels for parallel processing frameworks.

**Forgetting Paged Aggregation**: Files without paged aggregation require dozens to hundreds of metadata requests before data access begins. Can add seconds of latency.

**Wrong Page Size**: Using default 4KB page size defeats paged aggregation's purpose. Must explicitly set MB-scale pages.

**Misaligned Chunk Shape**: If chunks don't align with access patterns, every read touches many chunks. Reading one row when chunks are column-oriented wastes 10-100x bandwidth.

**Many Small Reads**: Application code that reads element-by-element or in small slices creates request storms. Batch reads into chunk-aligned operations.

**No Caching**: The ros3 VFD doesn't cache or optimize requests automatically. Each library call becomes immediate HTTP request without batching.

**Variable-Length Datatypes**: Vlen strings and datatypes don't work efficiently with HTTP range requests. Use fixed-length alternatives.

**Over-Compression**: Heavy compression (gzip level 9) increases decompression time without much size reduction. Level 3-5 usually optimal.

**Ignoring Access Patterns**: Writing chunks for convenience rather than expected read patterns. Always design chunking for how data will be consumed.
