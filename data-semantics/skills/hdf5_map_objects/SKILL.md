# HDF5 Map Objects

## Purpose

HDF5 1.14 introduced **map objects** — a native key-value store alongside groups and datasets. Maps store typed key→value pairs with no predefined schema, purpose-built for large flat lookups where group-based key-value simulation is too slow.

**Related skills**: `hdf5-vol-usage` (maps require a VOL connector implementing the map API), `hdf5-vol-dev` for implementing map-capable connectors.

## What Problem Maps Solve

Groups can simulate key-value storage, but they are optimized for hierarchical navigation, not random lookup. Storing millions of key-value pairs as group members creates metadata B-tree overhead and poor per-key access performance. Map objects provide:
- Large, flat, unordered key-value collections
- Dynamic key sets (insert/delete at runtime)
- Typed keys and values (any HDF5 datatype)
- Native support in connectors built on KV storage backends (e.g., DAOS)

## Critical Architecture Constraint

**Map objects are defined at the API level but not implemented in the native HDF5 file format.** The native VOL connector does not support map objects. Without a map-capable VOL connector, all `H5M*` calls fail immediately.

Current connectors with map support:
- **DAOS VOL** (HDF Group / Intel): maps natively to DAOS distributed KV store
- **Pass-through VOL**: can wrap map-capable connectors

There is no fallback to native HDF5 storage. If your environment does not have a map-capable VOL connector, map objects are not available.

## C API Overview

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `H5Mcreate(loc, name, key_type, val_type, lcpl, mcpl, mapl)` | Create map, declare key/value types |
| `H5Mopen(loc, name, mapl)` | Open existing map by name |
| `H5Mput(map, key_type, key, val_type, val, dxpl)` | Insert or overwrite a key-value pair |
| `H5Mget(map, key_type, key, val_type, val, dxpl)` | Retrieve value by key |
| `H5Mexists(map, key_type, key, exists, dxpl)` | Test for key presence |
| `H5Mdelete(map, key_type, key, dxpl)` | Remove a key |
| `H5Miterate(map, key_type, idx, callback, op_data, dxpl)` | Iterate over all keys |
| `H5Mget_count(map, count, dxpl)` | Number of entries |
| `H5Mclose(map)` | Release map handle |

h5py does not expose map objects in its high-level interface. Access requires the low-level `h5py.h5` layer or direct C/C++ code.

## Key and Value Datatypes

- Any fixed-size HDF5 type can be a key: integers, floats, fixed-length strings, compound types
- Variable-length strings as keys are supported if the VOL connector handles VL heap allocation
- Values accept any HDF5 type including VL, compound, and array types
- Key type and value type are **fixed at map creation** — schema cannot change after creation
- Prefer compact key types (integers, fixed-length strings) for best lookup performance in backend storage

## Property Lists

Map objects use dedicated property lists:
- `H5Pcreate(H5P_MAP_CREATE)` — map creation properties (currently VOL-connector-defined)
- `H5Pcreate(H5P_MAP_ACCESS)` — map access properties

Standard HDF5 property list lifecycle applies: create, set properties, pass to `H5Mcreate`/`H5Mopen`, close.

## Do / Do Not

**Do**:
- Verify your VOL connector implements `H5VL_MAP_*` operations before designing a map-based workflow
- Use typed integer or fixed-length string keys for predictable performance
- Call `H5Mexists` before `H5Mget` to avoid errors on missing keys
- Close maps with `H5Mclose` — same resource discipline as datasets and groups

**Do not**:
- Assume map objects work with the native HDF5 VOL — they do not
- Use maps for small collections (<100 entries) — group + attributes is simpler and universally portable
- Expect h5dump, HDFView, or h5py high-level API to read map objects — support is VOL-connector-specific
- Mix groups and maps to model the same concept within one file — choose one pattern
- Assume portability to standard `.h5` files — a DAOS-backed map file is not readable as native HDF5

## Portability

Map objects are **not portable** to the native HDF5 file format. A file written via DAOS VOL with map objects cannot be opened as a standard HDF5 file. This is a fundamental design constraint, not a tooling limitation.

If portability to h5py, h5dump, or HDFView is required, use groups or compound datasets instead.

## Maturity and Roadmap

Map objects are stable at the API level in HDF5 1.14. Real-world usage is confined to DAOS-backed environments as of HDF5 1.14.x. Native VOL map support is not on the published HDF Group roadmap. Monitor HDF Group release notes before adopting maps in a new architecture.

## When to Use Map Objects

- DAOS-backed HDF5 workflows requiring native KV semantics
- Very large flat key-value stores (millions of entries) where group B-tree overhead is measurable and profiled
- Typed metadata registries embedded in workflows already committed to a map-capable VOL

## When NOT to Use

- Any workflow requiring standard HDF5 file portability
- Environments without DAOS or another map-capable VOL connector
- Small key-value collections — use group attributes
- h5py-only Python workflows (no high-level API)
- Situations where `h5dump` or standard tooling must be able to inspect the file
